    \section{Lateral}
    Why wheels?

    \subsection{Overall Design}
    Full labeled detailed CAD\\
    Mass, dimensions, etc.\\
    Full cost breakdown, comments on manufacturability and production costs\\
    “A full Bill of Materials can be found in Appendix C.”

    \subsection{Structural}
    “Fully passive, so failsafe in case of power or other failures.”\\
    How does the system effectively dampen lateral vibration? Simulations.\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lateral response graph
    \end{itemize}
    High rpm issues, both structural and thermal\\
    What are several reasonable and edge-case loading scenarios, and how does the FEA look for all of those? Justify your “reasonable” scenarios. If possible to simulate, how many cycles might it withstand?

    \subsection{Tests \& Validation (completed and planned)}
    Test rig (see Next Steps as well)\\
    Fault tolerance, potential failure modes (FMEA)
