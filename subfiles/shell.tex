    \section{Shell}
    Justifications for design decisions
    \subsection{Overall Design}
    Full labeled detailed CAD\\
    Mass, dimensions, etc.\\
    Full cost breakdown, comments on manufacturability and production costs\\
    “A full Bill of Materials can be found in Appendix C.”

    \subsection{Aerodynamics}
    Analysis of aerodynamic coefficient\\
    Justification that this will not hit the Kantrowitz limit, and that the aerodynamic drag will be negligible

    \subsection{Structural}
    Choice of material - fiberglass vs carbon fibre\\
    What are several reasonable and edge-case loading scenarios, and how does the FEA look for all of those? Justify your “reasonable” scenarios. If possible to simulate, how many cycles might it withstand?\\
    Vacuum compatibility\\
    How do we deal with vibration?
