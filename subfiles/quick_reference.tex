        \end{enumerate}
        \item Predicted Pod thermal profile
        \item Predicted Pod trajectory (speed versus distance)
        \item Predicted vibration environments
        \item Pod structural design cases: at a minimum, this shall include initial acceleration, nominal deceleration, and a reasonably foreseeable off-nominal crash

            \item Cost (both production and maintenance)
            \item Estimated Pod mass and cost if built full-scale
            \item Maintenance (e.g. not requiring specialized alignment tools, hot-swappable subsystems)
        \end{enumerate}

            \item Description of how Pod is moved from Hyperloop to Exit Area
        \end{enumerate}
        \item List and description of any stored energy on the Pod (i.e. pressure vessels, batteries)
        \item List of any hazardous materials, if any
        \item Description of safety features including:
        \begin{enumerate}
