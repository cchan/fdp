\section{Our Team}
Waterloop is a team of ambitious students from the University of Waterloo who have been working to design and build prototype Hyperloop pods since September 2015 with the goal to compete in SpaceX's Hyperloop Pod Competitions. We hope to represent Canada's leading innovation on the world stage at Competition III.

The team is based in Waterloo, Ontario, Canadaâ€™s largest technology innovation hub. Waterloop has members studying in fields ranging from engineering to arts to environment to business, and our members also represent over 20 countries of origin. Our diverse team is united under the common goal of building a pod that is able to not only do well in competition, but can eventually be implemented in Canada's transportation infrastructure. We believe Hyperloop has the potential to link together the economy and shrink the world in a faster, cleaner, and more efficient way.

We are excited to build this cutting-edge technology with the potential to revolutionize - or even trivialize - the concept of distance. On a personal level, it has been an extraordinary experience teaching and learning technical and administrative skills, creating strong organizational and engineering practices, and, most of all, engaging in amazing teamwork. We are also proud to be actively promoting programs that will bring our own life-changing experiences to a wider community, including work with HeForShe Waterloo and hosting educational events to promote the importance of STEM in Canada's future. We hope to be a leader in Canada's surge back into the forefront of innovation.

\chapter{Top-Level Design}
\label{ch:top-level-design}

        \caption{CAD of Overall Design}
    \end{figure}

Our pod design process for Competition III began with the goal of building the fastest pod. Based purely on specific power and energy of lithium ion batteries (and perhaps supercapacitors), it is theoretically possible to achieve speeds above Mach 1 within the 1-mile Hyperloop test track. This year, our pod is designed to achieve \SI{100}{m/s}, and we are gradually working towards higher and higher speeds for future competitions.

\section{Summary of design}
Our pod consists of the following major components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Propulsion: Friction drive (wheels)
    \item Braking: High speed eddy current braking, low speed caliper brakes
    \item Lateral stability: Freely spinning wheels
    \item Frame: Aluminum ladder frame
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Size and Mass}
The size of the pod is primarily dictated by the size of the propulsion system and the size of the I-beam.\\
  The mass of the pod depends on the individual mass of each subsystem, as seen in \reftab{table:mass}. The overall mass of the pod should be approximately 149 kilograms.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lr@{}}
	\toprule Subsystem & Mass of Subsystem (\si{kg}) \\ \midrule
    Friction Drive & 55.8 \\
    Frame & 19.0 \\
    Electrical & 23.5 \\
    Embedded Systems & 2 \\
    Shell & 12.0 \\
    Eddy Current Braking & 27.0 \\
    Lateral & 10.1 \\ \midrule
    \textbf{Total} & \textbf{149.4}
\end{tabular}
  \caption{Mass of Individual Subsystems}
  \label{table:mass}
\end{table}


\subsection{Energy Storage and Usage}
Energy in the pod is stored in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Huge batteries
    \item Air tanks
    \item Lateral/EC Brakes springs
\end{itemize}
Energy is used in the pod by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Friction drive
    \item Electronic systems (electrically isolated)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Loading and Unloading Plan}
Due to the pod being relatively lightweight â€“ approximately 149 kilograms, the pod can simply be moved and lifted by 10 people. This distributes the mass to \SI{15}{kg} per person. Therefore, moving to and away from the Hyperloop competition is not a large safety concern.
\section{Scalability}
Our pod design seeks to be the simplest possible design for a Hyperloop. However, it is difficult to scale to high-subsonic speeds for several reasons.
In order to fully do so, the team will eventually need to gain experience with high power systems, high speed stability, and braking systems on a larger scale. The core concept of friction drive, that is, high-speed wheeled propulsion, is not very scalable. This is because the wheel rpm increases linearly with speed and centripetal force required increases with the square of the rpm. This means that at high speeds, the wheel faces very high stresses. This problem especially affects wheels of small radius, which have a higher rpm than wheels of a larger radius. However, the friction drive can be used for low speed control where other propulsion methods, such as a linear induction motor, are less efficient, or do not work outright. Additionally, there are sections of the friction drive that are still scalable to larger pod masses and velocities. The most prominent example is the suspension system, made up of a Watts linkage and airbag suspension units. Airbag suspensions are used in industrial applications where they bear high loads, such as in trains and semi trucks. The Watts linkage is a linkage used to allow vertical movement while restricting all other directions, and is used in older train suspension designs and off road trucks. The linkage is quite simple in design, and easy to implement in tight spaces. Since Waterloop is looking to use the friction drive as a segue into more speed-specific propulsion methods, such as a high speed LIM, its lack of scalability is not a particularly troublesome issue in our Hyperloop design.\\
