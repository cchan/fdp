\section{Our Team}
Waterloop is a team of ambitious students from the University of Waterloo who have been working to design and build prototype Hyperloop pods since September 2015 with the goal to compete in SpaceX's Hyperloop Pod Competitions. We hope to represent Canada's leading innovation on the world stage at Competition III.

The team is based in Waterloo, Ontario, Canadaâ€™s largest technology innovation hub. Waterloop has members studying in fields ranging from engineering to arts to environment to business, and our members also represent over 20 countries of origin. Our diverse team is united under the common goal of building a pod that cannot only do well in competition, but can eventually be implemented in Canada's transportation infrastructure. We believe Hyperloop has the potential to link together the economy and shrink the world in a faster, cleaner, and more efficient way.

We are excited to build cutting-edge technology with the potential to revolutionize - or even trivialize - the concept of distance. On a personal level, it has been an extraordinary experience teaching and learning technical and administrative skills, creating strong organizational and engineering practices, and most of all, engaging in amazing teamwork. We are also proud to be actively promoting programs that will bring our own life-changing experiences to a wider community, including work with HeForShe Waterloo and hosting educational events to promote the importance of STEM for Canada's future. We hope to be a leader in Canada's surge back into the forefront of innovation.

\chapter{Top-Level Design}
\label{ch:top-level-design}
Labeled CAD (Exploded? Semitransparent? Color coded?)\\

Our pod design process for Competition III began with the goal of building the fastest possible pod. Based purely on specific power and energy of lithium ion batteries (and perhaps supercapacitors), it is theoretically possible to achieve speeds above Mach 1 within the 1-mile Hyperloop test track. Our pod this year is designed to achieve 100 m/s, and we are gradually working towards higher and higher speeds for future competitions.


\section{Summary of design}
Our pod consists of the following major components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Propulsion: Friction drive (wheels)
    \item Braking: High speed eddy current braking, low speed caliper brakes
    \item Lateral stability: Freely spinning wheels
    \item Frame: Aluminum ladder frame
\end{itemize}
Uniqueness/Novelty\\
The Pod for the third competition differentiates itself from the previous one, primarily due to the incorporation of the propulsion system. This change has
Changes from PDB and reasoning for changes\\
If reusing a system in whole or part, explain changes\\

\subsection{Size and Mass}
The size of the pod is primarily dictated by the size of the propulsion system and the size of the I-beam.\\
  The mass of the pod depends on the individual mass of each subsystem, as seen in \reftab{table:mass}. The overall mass of the pod should be approximately 150 kilograms.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lr@{}}
	\toprule Subsystem & Mass of Subsystem (\si{kg}) \\ \midrule
    Friction Drive & 55.8 \\
    Frame & 19.0 \\
    Electrical & 23.5 \\
    Embedded Systems & unknown \\
    Shell & 12.0 \\
    Eddy Current Braking & 27.0 \\
    Lateral & 10.1 \\
\end{tabular}
  \caption{Mass of individual subsystems}
  \label{table:mass}
\end{table}

Overall weight distribution/Centre of mass\\
The cross-section of the pod is small enough that aerodynamic effects like the Kantrowitz limit\\
are negligible (IS THIS SENTENCE OUT OF PLACE? TODO).\\

\subsection{Energy Storage and Usage}
Where is energy stored onboard the pod?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Huge batteries
    \item Air tanks
    \item Lateral/EC Brakes springs?
\end{itemize}
Where is energy used onboard the pod?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Friction drive
    \item Electronic systems (electrically isolated)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overall pod thermal profile}
How are various parts of the pod cooled? (summarize) TODO

\subsection{Predicted Pod trajectory}
\reffig{fig:pod-trajectory-profile} describes the trajectory of the pod while braking.\\

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Pod Trajectory Profile During Braking}
    \label{fig:pod-trajectory-profile}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Loading and Unloading Plan}
Due to the pod being relatively lightweight â€“ approximately 150 kilograms, the pod can simply be moved and lifted by 10 people. Therefore, moving to and away from the Hyperloop competition is not a large safety concern.

\section{Scalability}
Our pod design seeks to be the simplest possible design for a Hyperloop. However, it is difficult to scale to high-subsonic speeds for several reasons.
In order to fully do so, the team will eventually need to gain experience with high power systems, high speed stability, and braking systems on a larger scale.\\

Preliminary analysis on scalability to an operational Hyperloop needs to be done with respect to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item System size (increased tube length, tube diameter, and Pod size)
    \item Cost (both production and maintenance)
    \item Estimated Pod mass and cost if built full-scale
    \item Maintenance (e.g. not requiring specialized alignment tools, hot-swappable subsystems)
    \item Power, cooling, safety, etc.
    \item Propulsion effectiveness
\end{itemize}
